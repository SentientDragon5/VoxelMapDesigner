Hello!

I made this tool that allows you to make voxel worlds.

To begin, add a VoxelMap Designer Component to an empty Gameobject at the orgin.
Next you need a palette, so go under the Settings foldout and add prefabs with 1x1x1
box colliders to the Palette List.
Now that you have populated the palette, shift-click on any object with a collider while
having the VoxelMap Designer Gameobject selected.
Holding shift will allow you to add Cubes, and Clicking will remove.

If you get annoyed at the box colliders, go to your scene view window, click under the
Gizmos options and untick the BoxCollider check.

Thank you and I hope this tool helps you create a great game.
Let me know how it goes and please credit.
